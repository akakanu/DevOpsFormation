    ### erreur Ã  ce niveau: Fail to UNREACHABLE! => { "changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out\r\n", "unreachable": true }
    ### Answers: The ansible-playbook command probably fails because the path to the ssh-key is not defined. Ansible recommends to use the ssh-agent:
    ### $ ssh-agent bash
    ### $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ### Another way to add private key files without using ssh-agent is using ansible_ssh_private_key_file in an inventory file as explained here
